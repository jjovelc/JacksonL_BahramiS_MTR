# Metagenomics of Tile and Rocks

This study investigates the presence and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in environmental biofilms. Periphyton samples were collected from aquatic systems influenced by wastewater effluent. A total of 24 periphyton samples were collected from two different surfaces to assess biofilm development over time:  natural rocks (long-term biofilms) and virgin tiles (short-term biofilms). Metagenomic libraries were prepared and sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq X Plus platform with 2Ã—150 bp paired-end reads to assess bacterial community composition and ARG prevalence.
